            <p>A game that lets you test if you have an eye for identifying fake news. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Choose your nickname and avatar, then a country to explore. Using the "Fake" and "Fact" buttons you will have to guess if each of the news presented are true or not. At the end, you will be able to see your score and find out if you are a fake news expert! Feel free to try again with the other countries available!</p>
            <br>
            <p>The game aims to teach how important it is to be able to identify fake news, and avoid their objective of distorting reality, maintaining the masses poorly informed and disconnected - even more so regarding collective debates, like elections, public health or public safety. When people can't distinguish what is true from what is manipulated, it fragilizes the democratic state and the public debate.</p> 
            <br>
